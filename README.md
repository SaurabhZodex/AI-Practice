## AI Practice

1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Foundations: math basics (algebra, probability and calculus), statistics and Python essentials.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data structures and visualization. Algorithms (trees, graphs‚Ä¶) and most common libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Traditional ML: Supervised/unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and clustering. Scikit-learn for ML model building and evaluation metrics.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning basics: neural networks and tools (Tensorflow or PyTorch).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Data science essentials: data clearing, feature engineering and EDA.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced AI topics: NLP, CV and Reinforcement Learning.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Generative AI and LLMs: Prompt Engineering and Foundation Models + advanced techniques (fine tuning and RAG).

8Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment and scaling: MLOps, LLMOps, Platforms and tools.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Ethics and Responsible AI
